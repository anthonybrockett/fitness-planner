The idea behind this platform is simple: there are an endless number of workouts out there, and keeping track of the ones you love is difficult!

Once exercises/workouts have been created, they can be viewed via the corresponding navigation links and modified (including adding exercises to a workout) by viewing the detail for that particular item.
